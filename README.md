## Mod Overview: Restoring Deprecated Content for Slay the Spire
#### - This mod focuses on reintroducing all deprecated content from Slay the Spire into the base game. It specifically includes cards and relics that were removed, but does not feature reworked cards.
#### - The one exception is the relic `Dark Core` which was never fully implemented, so it will not be featured here.
#### - I reference the notes.txt file (changelog) in finding the deprecated content, as well as looking through all the files to see if they include the keyword `DEPRECATED`.
